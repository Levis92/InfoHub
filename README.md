# InfoHub
This project is made for my personal use, but you're welcome to use any part of the code without restrictions. Some widgets may need API keys and it's up to you to acquire those yourself.

## Application
InfoHub is an application to display widgets on a screen. That's it. No accounts or special features for touchscreen monitors. Just for displaying information.

### Current widgets
* **Clock with time and date**
* **Västtrafik**
* **Twitter images**
* **Weather (Dark Sky API)**

## React

### Development
The first time you run the application (and every time you add new dependencies) you need do run:
```
npm install
```
After that you only need to run:
```
npm start
```

## Flask

### Development
The first time you run the application (and every time you add new dependencies) you need do run:
```

```
After that you only need to run:
```
./debug.sh
```
