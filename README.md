# InfoHub
This project is made for my personal use, but you're welcome to use any part of the code. Some widgets may need [API keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key) and it's up to you to acquire those yourself.

## Application
InfoHub is an application to display widgets on a screen. That's it. No accounts or special features for touchscreen monitors. Just for displaying information.

### Current widgets
* **Clock with time and date.** Displays the current time and date.

* **Västtrafik.** Displays the current departures from chosen bus-, tram- or trainstops. Needs API keys. You can get them from [developer.vasttrafik.se](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/).

* **Twitter images.** Displays the latest images from specified Twitter user.

* **Weather (Dark Sky API).** Displays current and hourly weather data for chosen location. Needs API key. You can get it from [darksky.net/dev](https://darksky.net/dev/).

## React
The frontend is built with the Javascript library [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and is styled with the CSS extension language [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).

### Development
First you need to add a copy of `widget-settings.example.js` and rename it to `widget-settings.js`. The file can be found in `infohub/src/components/`. Add your own settings in the file.

The first time you run the application (and every time you add new dependencies) you need do run:
```
npm install
```
After that you only need to run:
```
npm start
```

#### Sass
To compile the Sass files you need to have Sass installed. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](http://sass-lang.com/install).

There's a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) script included, so to compile you only need to run:
```
npm run sass
```

### Production
To build the React application you run:
```
npm run build
```

## Flask
The backend runs on the Python framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and is used as an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to request data and structure it in a format more convenient for the frontend application.

### Development
First you need to add a copy of `api_keys.example.py` and rename it to `api_keys.py`. The file can be found in `flask-app/InfoHubAPI/`. Add your API keys in this file.

The first time you run the application (and every time you add new dependencies) you need do run:
```
./init.sh
```
After that you only need to run:
```
./debug.sh
```

### Production
There are currently no specified script for production mode.
